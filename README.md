# autoCV

A clean CV template in LaTeX along with a GitHub action that complies the `*.tex` file and publishes a new PDF version when new changes are pushed to the repo

## Template Design

The template is designed to be clean with sections for
- Tabular sections for Work Experience, Education and Projects
- Support for including a list of publications read from a `*.bib` file
- Header with Font Awesome icons

## Quickstart
- Fork this repo (you can use the `Use this template` button)
- Give the workflow write permissions for your forked repo (Settings -> Actions -> General)
- Modify the `cv.tex` file and push changes to your repo
- Set GitHub pages source to build branch (Settings -> Pages)
- The complied PDF will be available under the `build` branch

You can get a direct link to the generated PDF which you can use on your website, LinkedIn etc. that will always point to the latest version of your CV. Once your site is published, your CV will be accessible at: `https://username.github.io/repo-name/`

NOTE: For the direct link to work, after editing your copy of `cv.tex` and pushing changes to your repo, under Settings -> Pages set your Github Pages source to the `build` directory
